    Working with clients to attempt to map their application and infrastructure needs to SSC services.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    When a project or initiative is identified as complex and in need of an integrated solution the request is sent to SISD for conceptual and detailed design.
    
    The Solution Architecture disipline involves a deep knowledge of SSC services, IT/Cyber Security and Netowrk solutions.
    
    The role involves direct interaction with Account Executive teams, client techncial leads and business owners.
    
    Conceptual Designs consist of the identification of the SSC services that should be assembled into the final solution, along with any application or functional requirements that generate a service gap that will need to be explored to meet the client needs.  As a Senior Advisor in SISD my main focus is working with the clients and SISD team to discover client requirements, map services, quantify gaps and eventually design and document a solution. I am currently working with Enterprise Archicture (EA) team to explore process improvement and a transition to SISD deliverables into the SISD EA tool using the Archimate design language.
