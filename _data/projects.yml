    When a project or initiative is identified as complex and in need of an integrated solution the request is send to SISD for conceptual and detailed design.

    Conceptual Designs consist of the identification of the SSC services that should be assembled into the final solution, along with any application or functional requirements that generate a service gap that will need to be explored to meet the client needs.  As a Senior Advisor in SISD my main focus is working with the clients and SISD team to discover client requirements, map services, quantify gaps and eventually design and document a solution.

    I am more comfortable in front of a terminal or powershell prompt than in a GUI. While my Operations days are in the past, my passion for learning, technology and tinkering always helps to keep my skills current in the evolving field of server administration. 

    Experienced with shell and powershell scripting, and day-to-day advanced operational troubleshooting and administration.
